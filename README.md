a small library for machine learning written in go

While learning machine learning course online, I am thinking about build a library for my study.

Here are several reasons:

1. Since I mostly understand the math behind the course I am studying, coding can help me have a better understanding of machine learning and inspire me to improve the existing library.
2. Most ML library nowadays are written in python, which is a language I honestly don't really like. One reason is the forced format, another reason is the functions usually looks too simple, and beginner need to spend much time on understanding and trying to remeber those functions.
3. I find Go is more than a language only suitable for develop server, and of course machine learning. its a language make me feel ease while coding.

the code is still under testing, you can use or modify it as you wish ;-)
